For JSON files, format the entire file automatically without need to first select the text. Minify and sorting commands are available too.\n\nThis plugin will post a notification to Atom if there is a parse error in the JSON. Disable warnings in this plugin's settings panel if you do not desire this feature.\n\nTo proactively avoid JSON errors, consider using a linter for JSON, such as the delightful [linter-jsonlint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-jsonlint).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/federomero/pretty-json/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/federomero/pretty-json#readme","_id":"pretty-json@1.0.0","_shasum":"66e66d9cf513ac84b43f72f6f23523fb479252e5","_resolved":"file:../d-11636-12963-wmx4qn/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11636-12963-wmx4qn/package.tgz"}
