Then call ```createSelection``` from the menu ```atom-justify```. This will select the first block.\n\nNow you can use 3 commands to justify the block -> ```JustifyLeft```, ```JustifyRight``` and ```Justify```. The last mentioned command will just switch between left and right.\n\n## See it in action\n\n![atom-justify](http://papermoon1978.github.io/atom-justify.gif)\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Andre Lerche](https://github.com/papermoon1978)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/papermoon1978/atom-justify/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/papermoon1978/atom-justify","_id":"atom-justify@0.4.1","_shasum":"88c31ac6ec24e9726e212eff9db4cc26a1807d81","_resolved":"file:../d-115511-70006-zr2d5j/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115511-70006-zr2d5j/package.tgz"}
