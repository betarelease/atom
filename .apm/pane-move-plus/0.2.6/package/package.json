Optimally in a grid style layout I would want to be able to move files up and down (Esentially skiping any sibling panes).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chemoish/atom-pane-move/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/chemoish/atom-pane-move","_id":"pane-move-plus@0.2.6","_shasum":"dbdd1106cf9abb67e4099516153e544303586251","_resolved":"file:../d-11545-66214-fzzcor/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11545-66214-fzzcor/package.tgz"}
