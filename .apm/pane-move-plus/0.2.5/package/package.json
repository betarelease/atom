Optimally in a grid style layout I would want to be able to move files up and down (Esentially skiping any sibling panes).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chemoish/atom-pane-move/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/chemoish/atom-pane-move","_id":"pane-move-plus@0.2.5","_shasum":"19a7c3608a8b591d84d786f7d5aecb9cd521c4d8","_resolved":"file:../d-115212-4721-51s7ln/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115212-4721-51s7ln/package.tgz"}
