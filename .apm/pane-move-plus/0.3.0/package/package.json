Optimally in a grid style layout I would want to be able to move files up and down (Esentially skiping any sibling panes).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chemoish/atom-pane-move/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/chemoish/atom-pane-move","_id":"pane-move-plus@0.3.0","_shasum":"62049b297f0a21199115f65804facb74c6b9329a","_resolved":"file:../d-115410-92918-nk67d8/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115410-92918-nk67d8/package.tgz"}
