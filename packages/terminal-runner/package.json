Awesome for running tests or build commands.\n\nRequires the [terminal](https://github.com/atom/terminal) package. **Same disclaimer applies**: This package is alpha and probably buggy. Proceed at your own risk!\n\nYou can run a command with `ctrl-r` or from the command palette via `cmd-p`, typing '*run com*', and selecting the '*Terminal Runner: Run Command*' command. The first time you run a command a new terminal session will be opened which will be reused for subsequent commands. You can run the last command again without the command prompt with `ctrl-shift-r`.\n",
